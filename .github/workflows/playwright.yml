      - name: Merge reports
        run: |
          # Let Playwright merge reports into the default 'playwright-report' directory
          npx playwright merge-reports --reporter html ./all-reports
          # Now, rename the default output directory to match what our upload step expects
          mv playwright-report playwright-merged-report```
This new script does two things:
1.  `npx playwright merge-reports ...`: Merges all reports from the `all-reports` directory and creates a new folder named `playwright-report` with the final result.
2.  `mv playwright-report playwright-merged-report`: Immediately renames (`mv` stands for "move") the `playwright-report` folder to `playwright-merged-report`. This ensures the next step (`Upload merged report artifact`) finds the folder it's looking for.
